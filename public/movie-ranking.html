<h1>The Best Movies According to Perper</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Rashomon</h3>
<p>An excellent take on how reality is subjective</p>
<h3>Waking Life</h3>
<p>The animated film that drowns you in a surreal world of a dreamstate that dips its finger in your brain through philosophic dialogues</p>
<h3>The night of the Hunter</h3>
<p>A noir/thriller with excellent direction</p>
